      <h1>History of Artificial Intelligence: From Ancient Roots to Modern</h1>

      <h3>-Artificial Intelligence (AI) has captured the imagination of humanity for centuries,evolving from mythical tales of automata
      <br>to groundbreaking technological advancements in the 21st century.
      <br>-This article provides a concise overview of the key milestones in the history of AI,
      tracing its journey from ancient roots<br>
      to the present day.</h3>
      
      <p><h5>-Ancient Beginnings:</h5> The fascination with creating artificial beings dates back to ancient civilizations.
      <br>Mythologies from ancient Greece, Egypt, and China feature stories of mechanical beings imbued with intelligence and autonomy, such as Talos and <br>the Golem.</p>
      
      
      <p><h5>-The Birth of Modern AI:</h5> The 20th century saw the emergence of modern AI as a field of study. In 1956, a group of researchers, including John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell,<br> and Herbert A. Simon, convened at Dartmouth College to discuss the potential for creating intelligent machines. This event is widely regarded as the birth of AI <br> as an academic discipline.</p>
      
      <p><h5>-Early Successes:</h5> The late 1950s and 1960s witnessed significant progress in AI research,<br>
        with the development of programs capable of solving mathematical problems, playing games like chess and checkers, and even engaging <br> in natural language processing.</p>
            
      <p><h5>-Resurgence and Breakthroughs:</h5> The late 20th century and early 21st century saw a resurgence of interest in AI,<br>
        fueled by advances in computing power, algorithm development, and data availability. Breakthroughs in areas such as  <br>machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning revolutionized the field, enabling AI systems to surpass human <br> performance in tasks like image recognition, language translation, and strategic games.</p>
      
      <p><h5>-Applications Across Industries:</h5> AI has found applications across a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance,<br>
        transportation, and entertainment.</p>
